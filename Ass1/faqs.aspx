        <h4>How many designers do you currently employ?</h4>
        <p>
            We currently have 10 in-house designers and hundreds of freelance designers who submit their work to us. We only employ 
            Australian designers to support the fashion industry in Australia.
        </p>

        <h4>How do I get my design printed?</h4>
        <p>
            If you wish to have your design featured on one of our t-shirts, please send an email to 
            <a class="links" href="mailto:bckhe1@student.monash.edu">Bai Chan</a> for further information.

        <h4>Do you ship overseas?</h4>
        <p>
            No, unfortunately we don't ship overseas at the moment. It is, however, something we're working 
            on providing in the very near future. Stay tuned!
        </p>

        <h4>
            How much does shipping cost?
        </h4>
        <p>
            Shipping is free for all our Australian customers. Enjoy!
        </p>

        <h4>How does the charity donation work?</h4>
        <p>
            We strong believe in giving back to the community, so for each t-shirt sold, we will donate 5% to a charity 
            of your choice. 
        </p>
        <h4>Cool!</h4>
